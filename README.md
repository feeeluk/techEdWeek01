TechEd first submission

There are few things that I probably wouldn't do in a real environment, e.g. write all text in lower case and use CSS to make it upper case.
This was purely just to experiment... the footer was a great little reminder of why I wouldn't. It's so much easier to type 'SpaceY' than it is to get the same effect using css.

To add something a little extra (I didn't want to run off and do something we haven't covered yet) I've added a link to the 'you might not have to sell a kidney! > read more' button..
This will take you to a virtually identical page, only if you then hover over the 'where is the moon?' button you should be able to find the moon.
